<p>In my spare time I dabble around a bit in agriculture. I've got 72 acres 10 from which I harvest hay and another 10 or so for pasture. Doesn't VS code wrap text? Wow! Talk about your poorly formed paragraph! How's this one? Just going to add a little more text here to see how far I can actually go before it does wrap. Nothing yet? A little more, little more, little more, little more hmmm.</p>
